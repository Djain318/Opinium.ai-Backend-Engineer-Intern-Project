## üöÄ Overview 
 
This project implements a data transformation pipeline that fetches raw event data from multiple public APIs, normalizes and enriches it using business rules, and provides an API to query the processed data. 
 
## üöÄ Features 
 
- Fetches data from three public sources: 
  - E-commerce product data 
  - User data 
  - Transaction/order data 
- Transforms and normalizes data into a unified format. 
- Applies business rules: 
  - Joins transaction data with product data to include product details. 
  - Joins transaction data with user data for complete purchase records. 
  - Calculates total spending per user. 
  - Identifies the most popular product categories. 
  - Computes the average transaction value. 
- Provides FastAPI-based endpoints for querying processed data. 
 
## üöÄ Data Sources 
 
The following public APIs are used: 
 
**1Ô∏è‚É£ Products API**: [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) 
 
- Endpoint: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` 
- Represents the product catalog. 
 
**2Ô∏è‚É£ Users API**: [RandomUser API](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20) 
 
- Endpoint: `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20` 
- Represents user profiles. 
 
**3Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions API**: [Mockaroo API](https://my.api.mockaroo.com/orders.json?key=e49e6840) 
 
- Endpoint: `https://my.api.mockaroo.com/orders.json?key=e49e6840` 
- Represents purchase transactions. 
 
## üöÄ Data Transformation 
 
All fetched data is transformed into the following standardized format: 
 
```json 
{ 
    "entity_id": "generated-unique-id", 
    "entity_type": "product|user|transaction", 
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601-format", 
    "data": { 
      "Normalized fields from the source" 
    }, 
    "metadata": { 
        "source": "which API", 
        "processed_at": "processing timestamp" 
    } 
} 
``` 
 
## üöÄ API Endpoints

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Endpoints Using Swagger UI** 
 
FastAPI provides an interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. Once the server is running: 
 
- Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` 
- You can interact with all the API endpoints directly from this interface. 
 
Alternatively, you can use Redoc: 
 
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## üöÄ **How I approach to solve the Problem ?**   
 
I started by understanding the requirements, which involved building a FastAPI backend that fetches data from multiple APIs, processes it, and provides insights on users, transactions, and products.  
- For data fetching and transformation, I used `requests` to get data from external APIs and applied a decorator (`transform_response`) to standardize the format, adding metadata and timestamps.   
- To process the data efficiently, I created lookup dictionaries for users and products, then enriched transactions by merging them with relevant details.   
- For insights, I calculated total spending per user, identified the most popular product category, and computed the average transaction value.   
- FastAPI endpoints were set up to fetch raw data (`/data/{entity_type}`) and provide insights on user spending (`/insights/user`) and popular product categories (`/insights/product`).   
- To optimize performance, I made fetched data global to avoid redundant API calls. Debugging included fixing issues like `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'` by ensuring correct data structures.   
Finally, for deployment, I considered Render.
